Some views are not decorated with @login_required, which means that they can be accessed without logging in.

Some functions don't have any error gaurantee, which means that data in database may be mistakenly updated before we catch an error.

Some functions are not following POST/REDIRECT/GET pattern, which means that the same data may be posted more than once when user
refresh the page. For example, a ride request may be submitted twice and making two open rides in the database.

We didn't check the data validation when user submit an operation. For example, when a driver wants to confirm a ride, the ride has
probably already been confirmed by anothere driver. This will cause an undefined behavior.

Some behaviors requested in GET method changes data in database. This enables malicous users to use manipulate our database via url.
